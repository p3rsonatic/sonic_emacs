My simple Emacs 30 Configuration - still tweaking and learning
It was mainly made with AI because I hate wasting time with configs.

## Why?

I hate configuring things, to the point that I use GNOME, I think it is "sane engineering", I also hate having to learn tons of keybindings, but Emacs allows maximum expression and somewhat frictionless integration of many workflows. 
Emacs distributions and starter packs sometimes feel verbose, Emacs 30 already has eglot and tree-sitter, and I intend to use it as an editor and personal knowledge system integrated with also my workflow as a medical student, therefore the use of anki-editor (which I am still learning). I used/use Logseq (for notes) + syncthing + LaTeX (for summaries, slides and formal texts) and Emacs allows me to take notes and convert them to LaTeX with some ease, while also allowing me to do flashcards and clozes without much extra effort.


## Packages:
Includes org, org-roam, org-babel, anki-editor, Modus Vivendi theme, which-key.
